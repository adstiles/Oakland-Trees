7/21/2012 Code for Oakland hackathon event
- We added common names for 11,000+ tree species from USDA Plant Checklist (using Google refine)
- Geocoded some tree data (but not all) based on address data.
- We are asking the City of Oakland for information about when tree data was collected and by whom. (Oakland website does not supply this information.)
- Considering creating a database of edible, medicinal and graftable fruit trees.
- Researched seasonality data 
- Reached out to CUESA about making their local seasonal data machine readable. (http://cuesa.org/page/seasonality-chart-fruit-and-nuts)
